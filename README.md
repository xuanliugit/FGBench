## Quick start
### Usage 

```
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("xuan-liu/FGBench") # Loading all 

dataset_test = load_dataset("xuan-liu/FGBench", split = "test") # Benchmark dataset

dataset_train = load_dataset("xuan-liu/FGBench", split = "train")
```

This dataset is constructed with functional group information based on MoleculeNet dataset. The datasets and tasks used in FGBench are listed below.
